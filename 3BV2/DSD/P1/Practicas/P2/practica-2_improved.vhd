The code presented is an entity-architecture declaration for component P2. The component has several inputs including clock (CLK), asynchronous clear (CLR), asynchronous preset (PRE), data (D), select (SEL) and two more inputs SR and JK. The two outputs of the component are Q(1) and Q(0).

The component has a process block that is sensitive to the inputs CLK, CLR, PRE, SEL, SR, JK, T and D. The process block has several conditions, where the logic of the component is defined. The key part of the code is the CASE statement with the following alternatives of SEL values: "00", "01", "10" and "others".

Here is the refactored code:

```vhdl
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity P2 is
    Port (
        CLK, PRE, CLR, T, D: in std_logic;
        SR, JK, SEL: in std_logic_vector(1 downto 0);
        Q: inout std_logic_vector(1 downto 0)
    );
end P2;

architecture A_P2 of P2 is
begin 

Q_process: process (CLK, CLR, PRE, SEL, SR, JK, T, D)
begin
    if CLR = '0' then
        Q <= "01";
    elsif rising_edge(CLK) then
        if PRE = '1' then
            Q <= "10";
        else
            case SEL is
                when "00" =>
                    Q <= SR;
                when "01" =>
                    Q(1) <= JK(1) and Q(0) or (not JK(0)) and Q(1);
                    Q(0) <= not (JK(1) and Q(0) or (not JK(0)) and Q(1));
                when "10" =>
                    Q(1) <= T and Q(0) or (not T) and Q(1);
                    Q(0) <= not(T and Q(0) or (not T) and Q(1));
                when others =>
                    Q(1) <= D;
                    Q(0) <= not D;
            end case;
        end if;
    end if;
end process Q_process;
end architecture A_P2;
```

In the refactored code, minor changes were made to improve readability and simplicity. The condition `(CLK'EVENT AND CLK = '1')` in the original code has been replaced with the rising_edge function to make the code more concise. 

A process name (Q_process) was added in the refactored code to avoid errors related to sensitivity lists. The modifications done to the code do not alter the functionality of the module.
